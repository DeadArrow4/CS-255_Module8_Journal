# CS-255_Module8_Journal
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company with a goal to help improve drivers training before they go to the DMV. DriverPass is hoping to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV)

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well through out the entire CS-255 class. I was able to understand what the client wanted and create accurate system requirements to meet their needs. I personally think my ability to create the multiple diagrams improved significantly throughout the course.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I could go into further detail on the various requirements. I believe I did well to meet the bottom line descriptions and explainations but further detail could improve the work I did a lot.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I read the interview throughly to ensure I understood what was required of me correctly. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because otherwise you have an out of touch system that isn't at all what the user base wants. It also can result in a faulty system that may be unusable.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I struggle with breaking down a larger design into smaller parts to make it more understandable but I know that it helps me understand and impliment everything correctly and also leads to less back tracking to fix things. I tend to want to just jump in and code whatever comes to my mind but now and from when i started coding I realized I am much better at slowing down and create plans to keep my work tidy and on track.
